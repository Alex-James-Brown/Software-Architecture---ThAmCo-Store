# Teesside University Software Architecture Assessment 2016-17

This solution was produced by myself as part of an assessment for my final year Software Architecture module; 
I got 90% for this assessment.

This was a group assessment, we had to architect a system based around a supplied specification, each member was
then allocated different parts of the architecture to implement; the work packages were individually marked. Some
of the projects within this solution are incomplete, these projects are just code that I produced for the other
member's projects.

The majority of my work packages were to create microservices which communicated with external store APIs, I also
created a authentication/authorisation service for the "ThAmCo" store; these were all developed using ASP.NET WebApi.
I contributed some facade classes to other member's MVC and WebApi projects.
